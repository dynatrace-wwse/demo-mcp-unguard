# Getting started

Before you begin working with the MCP-enabled agent, you'll need to connect to the MCP server.

## Required Access

!!! info "MCP Server Connection Options"
    You have two ways to connect to the MCP server:

    **Option 1: Web Version with Password**
    - Use the web-based IDE
    - You'll need the **MCP server password** provided by your instructor or administrator

    **Option 2: Single Sign-On (SSO)**
    - Requires the **IDE Desktop version**
    - Uses Dynatrace's SSO authentication
    - No password required - authenticate through your identity provider

!!! tip "Choose your connection method"
    Select the option that works best for your environment. SSO provides seamless authentication but requires the desktop IDE, while password authentication works in both web and desktop versions.

## What You'll Get Access To

Once connected to the MCP server, you'll be able to:

- **Analyze code** in the repository using the AI agent
- **Query Dynatrace insights** from the monitoring tenant
- **Get real-time observability data** to understand application behavior
- **Interact with Davis CoPilot** for intelligent problem analysis

!!! tip "Ready to connect?"
    Once you have your MCP server access (either password or SSO), you're ready to move to the next step!
