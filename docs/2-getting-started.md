# Getting started

Before you begin working with the MCP-enabled agent, you'll need to tell the agent to which Dynatrace environment it should connect to. The MCP Server supports SSO via VS Code Desktop and Web 🚀.


!!! info "Playground as default environment"
    By default if no environment is set, the DT_ENVIRONMENT variable will point to the playground [https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com)


## Required Access
You need access to a Dynatrace environment, if not, [create a Free Trial - sign up here](https://dt-url.net/trial){target="_blank"}) which will allow you also access to the Playground environment.



## What You'll Get Access To

Once connected to the MCP server, you'll be able to:

- **Analyze code** in the repository using the AI agent
- **Query Dynatrace insights** from the monitoring tenant
- **Get real-time observability data** to understand application behavior
- **Interact with Davis CoPilot** for intelligent problem analysis
