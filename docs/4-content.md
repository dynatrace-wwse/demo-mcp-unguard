here is the source code
https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/unguard

you can find it under the unguard folder. 


Now Let's chat with the LLM agent:


Which information can I get from my dynatrace environment? which actions can I execute?


- Do I have security vulnerabilities in my code?

 _When it does then ask for details or tell the agent to fix it for you_ _do not compile in the ide, we don't want to deploy



- generate me a security remediation markdown summary of the fixes.

- Show the changes in the source code


when it finishes then ask to tackle another vulnerabilit instead of building the project
