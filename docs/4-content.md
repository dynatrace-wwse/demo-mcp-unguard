here is the source code
https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/unguard

you can find it under the unguard folder. 


Now Let's chat with the LLM agent:


Which information can I get from my dynatrace environment? which actions can I execute?


- Do I have security vulnerabilities in my code?

 _When it does then ask for details or tell the agent to fix it for you_ _do not compile in the ide, we don't want to deploy



- generate me a security remediation markdown summary of the fixes.

- Show the changes in the source code


when it finishes then ask to tackle another vulnerabilit instead of building the project


what tools are installed in dynatrace mcp server and what can I do with them? give me a comprehensive list.

Do I have security vulnerabilities in my environment and do they affect the code in my IDE?

yes fix the first two ones please


No, please make an executive summary of the fixes adding the impacted infrastructure.
