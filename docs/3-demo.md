Welcome! This guide will walk you through connecting to the MCP server and starting your analysis with the AI agent.

## Step 1:Connecting the MCP Server 

!!! info "Steps to establish an MCP Server Connection"
    - On the IDE go to the left pane > `Extensions > MCP Servers Installed  > dynatrace-mcp-server`
    - Open dynatrace-mcp-server click on the configuration wheel > Start server
    - The server should start, it'll read the environment file located in .devcontainer/runlocal/.env and will read the variable DT_ENVIRONMENT
    - In the Server output (click on Show Output in the configuration wheel )
    - A link for the SSO authentication should open automatically (if not then click on it).
    !!! success ""
        - you should see a prompt like "✅ Successfully retrieved token from SSO!" now let the agents communicate with the environment.
         


!!! question "Connect to another environment"
    - There is a comfort function that helps you set the DT_ENVIRONMENT variable called `selectEnvironment`.
    - Type `selectEnvironment` in the terminal, select an environment or enter your own environment.
    - Restart the MCP Server by going to `Extensions > MCP Servers Installed  > dynatrace-mcp-server > restart server`



## Step 2: Start Chatting with the Agent

After successfully connecting to the MCP server, you can now interact with the AI agent!

The agent has access to:

- **Code Analysis**: Analyze the application code in this repository
- **Dynatrace Insights**: Query logs, metrics, traces, and events from the monitoring tenant
- **Davis CoPilot**: Get intelligent recommendations and problem analysis
- **Observability Data**: Access real-time monitoring data and application behavior

!!! info "Ask the agent what can you do with the MCP Server"
    A very useful question is to ask the agent what can you do with Dynatrace's MCP Server. The MCP Server is pulling from `latest` meaning every week you'll get more features. In order to check the latest stand, just ask the agent and it'll give you a comprenhensive list of what you can do depending on the tools installed at that time.

## Step 3: Explore and Analyze

You're all set! Start exploring the codebase and monitoring data. The agent will help you understand the application, identify issues, and get insights from Dynatrace.

You'll find the source code of the unguard application in the folder `unguard`. The original source code is hosted here: https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/unguard


!!! tip "Connect to another Dynatrace environment"
    If you want to conect to another Dynatrace Environment/MCP Server, just type in the terminal `selectMcpServer`
